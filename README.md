This project is dedicated to calculating the Fourier transforms of autocorrelation and crosscorrelation functions
(power spectra) of quantities present in N-body cosmological simulations, 
such as density or velocity fields. To this end, the FFTW library is used extensively.

It uses two text or binary files of one-component fields (density, velocity divergence, some component of velocity or vorticity).
